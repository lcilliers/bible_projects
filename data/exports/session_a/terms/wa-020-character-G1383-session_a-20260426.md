## About this document

This document is the Session A input for **Verse Context classification** of
a single OWNER term — `G1383` *dokimion* (testing) from registry
020 character. It contains the STEP-sourced data for this one term only.
Per alignment analysis v4 §7 and §8, the term is the atomic unit of VC
classification; this document presents the term in the scope the method
actually operates on.

Read the VC instruction in full before beginning. This document is the
**data**; the instruction is the **method**. The `.md` carries no analytical
content from downstream stages (no Session B findings, no dimensional
placements, no Session C prose, no Session D synthesis).

### Prior-state posture (this term)

This term has **1 active** prior `verse_context_group`
rows (0 dissolved). Approach this as a
**RE-EVALUATION** — every prior classification will be reviewed under
the current filter and grouping model; every pre-existing active group
must be retained (with verses), dissolved, or documented-retained at
term close. No silent pass-through. See VC Instruction §6.1
(prior-state posture declaration) and §6.2 Step 6 (re-evaluation
self-check + orphan-group check).

### Method reminder

> **Governing filter (VC Instruction §3).** For each verse, ask:
> *Does this verse, through the use of this term, say something about the
> inner being — the non-physical, internal states, capacities, and
> expressions that constitute a person's invisible life: how a person
> thinks, feels, chooses, relates, and orients themselves toward meaning,
> others, and God?*
> If yes → classify the contextual meaning. If no → set aside
> (`is_relevant = 0`, with a `set_aside_reason` from the controlled
> vocabulary: `no_inner_being` / `physical_only` / `spatial_only` /
> `wrong_face` / `other`).
>
> **Grouping model (VC Instruction §6.2 Step 3 — characteristic-perspective).**
> Groups are formed from the perspective of the inner-being characteristic
> the verse cluster is primarily about — not from the perspective of what
> the term does. For property terms especially, name the characteristic
> being served (seat / channel / expression / mechanism / obstacle /
> counterpart), not just the term's function. Reuse existing groups where
> they fit; create a new group only when the inner-being characteristic is
> materially different, or the same characteristic is engaged in a
> materially different way.
>
> **Anchor designation (VC Instruction §4).** 1–2 anchor verses per group,
> each making the contextual meaning evident without surrounding context.
> Every term must have at least one active anchor (Rule R4).

## 3. Verses

The complete verse corpus for each OWNER term. This is the object of
classification. Every active verse (`delete_flagged = 0`) must be assessed
against the governing filter. Any existing `verse_context` state is shown
per verse as **Prior classification** — review, and revise only where
clearly warranted (VC Instruction §6.2 Step 2).

## 6. Questions

Open questions from the programme's observation catalogue linked to the
data-quality flags present on this registry. These are for awareness —
classification work may surface answers; many will be addressed in
Session B. Do not try to answer them here.


| obs_id | code | triggering flag | question |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 199 | `Q-COV-05` | `VERSE_EVIDENCE_CONCENTRATED` | Was STEP's verse capture exhausted for this term? Was any pagination or filter step incomplete? |
| 200 | `Q-COV-06` | `VERSE_EVIDENCE_CONCENTRATED` | What do the few verses that exist establish about the term's inner-being contribution? |
| 201 | `Q-COV-07` | `VERSE_EVIDENCE_CONCENTRATED` | Does the narrow verse set concentrate in a particular literary genre, historical period, or speaker? |

## Footer — what happens next

A Claude AI Verse Context session produces a `VERSECONTEXT` patch
covering this term (and any others classified in the same session).
The patch must declare `_patch_meta.terms_covered` including
`mti_term_id = 4843`. On apply, Claude Code flips
this term's `mti_terms.vc_status` to `complete` and re-derives the
owning registry's `verse_context_status` from the aggregate of all
its OWNER + XREF-via-OWNER term statuses (VC-2 in the applicator;
alignment analysis v4 §8.2).
