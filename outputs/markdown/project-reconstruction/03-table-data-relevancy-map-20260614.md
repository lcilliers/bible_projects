# Table & Data Relevancy Map — usage / data-consumption view

> Built 2026-06-14 by working **backwards from the latest work** (per researcher direction). Two evidence sources, no inference-as-fact:
> 1. **Forensics** — per-table row count + last-write date (max timestamp column) from the live DB. This is the *data-consumption recency* signal: recently written = live; long-stale = candidate legacy.
> 2. **Documentary supersession** — what the dated written record explicitly says was retired/replaced (cited; see `02-failures-oversights-rework-log-20260614.md`).
>
> **Each table gets an EVIDENCE row and a PROPOSED status.** Where the documents do **not** explicitly settle a table's fate, the status is marked `⚠ PROPOSED — confirm` and is for the researcher to ratify. I supply the evidence; the researcher adjudicates. This is deliberately *not* asserted as final truth — that is the failure mode we are correcting.
>
> Caveat on dates: last-write = newest value in a timestamp column. Tables with **no** timestamp column show `—` (can't be dated this way) and are judged by row count + documentary evidence. A few writes (e.g. June morph-backfill into `wa_verse_records`) may not bump the table's `last_changed`, so treat a stale date on a foundational table as "structure stable," not "unused."

## Legend (the five buckets you asked for)

| Bucket | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **CURRENT-CORE** | Central to the live L1/L2 + cluster/finding model; written by current work |
| 🟢 **CURRENT-INFRA** | Live engine/logging/control |
| 🔵 **FOUNDATION** | Stable Session-A term/verse data; last written mid-May; **read** constantly, rarely rewritten |
| 🟡 **STALE-RELEVANT** | Superseded model, but data retained/referenced or pending migration — *do not delete* |
| 🟠 **STALE-DEAD** | Legacy of a retired phase; no current reads/writes; candidate for retirement |
| ⚪ **EMPTY/UNUSED** | 0 rows or never used; not relevant |
| 🔮 **FUTURE** | Schema in place, not yet populated (planned) |

| `wa_rule_registry` | 59 | 2026-04-17 | 🟡 REFERENCE | Reference-as-DB rules (M32). Governance reference; static. |

## E. EMPTY / UNUSED (not relevant)

## How to act on this (proposed, for your ratification)

1. **Nothing in 🟡/🟠/⚪ should be dropped on this map alone.** Each `⚠ confirm` is a question for you, not a verdict. The map's job is to put the evidence in one place.
2. **Highest-value confirmations** (these change how CLAUDE.md and queries should describe the DB):
   - Is the **C-code dimension layer** (`wa_dimension_index`, `word_registry.cluster_assignment`) being *kept* as a parallel index, or retired now that M-code clusters are the model? (Patience's `C08` hangs on this.)
   - Are **`wa_session_b_findings` + `wa_finding_catalogue_links`** to be migrated into `finding` (per the post-M56 rule) or frozen as historical?
   - Can the **`session_d_*`, `sources`, `themes`, `prose_section_*_link`** empties be dropped?
3. **The `finding` table (343k rows) is the live centre of gravity** — any "what's in the DB" description or CLAUDE.md refresh must lead with it, not with `word_registry`.
4. **OT-DBR-009 (`mti_terms` dedup)** sits under the CURRENT-CORE term master — unresolved and affecting ~2,209 verses' findings. It is the one integrity issue inside the live layer.

> Cross-checks: row counts + last-write from live DB forensics (2026-06-14); supersession claims cited in `02-failures-oversights-rework-log-20260614.md`; current read/write usage from the June reader against `wa-cluster-rollup-instruction-v3_2-DRAFT-20260607.md` and `wa-cluster-rollup-design.md`.

## Issues surfaced 2026-06-14 (from the open-loops scan — ratify before any CLAUDE.md refresh)

These four change how specific tables should be bucketed; each is a decision for you (see also `04-open-loops-and-incomplete-methodology-20260614.md`).

1. **Catalogue tables are mid-refactor — CURRENT but *unstable*.** `wa_obs_question_catalogue` (412), `finding_question_link` (332,184) and `wa_finding_catalogue_links` (6,199) are tied to the two-layer VE/SYNTH **catalogue refit that is approved on paper but not yet applied to the DB** (the 189 T-questions are being re-dispositioned; 16 DROP soft-deleted). Treat their *current shape as not settled* — they will move when the refit lands. → re-bucket `wa_obs_question_catalogue` from STALE-RELEVANT to **CURRENT-MUTATING**.

2. **C-code layer needs an explicit keep-or-retire decision — the biggest "stale-but-referenced" ambiguity.** `wa_dimension_index` (3,509), `word_registry.cluster_assignment` (C01–C22) and `wa_dim_review_cluster_log` (6) belong to **dimension review, which was eliminated 2026-05-04** — yet the C-codes remain the registry's *only* cluster pointer while the live M-codes live in `cluster`/`mti_terms.cluster_code`. **Two parallel cluster systems, no decision on whether C is retired.** Until decided, these stay 🟡 STALE-RELEVANT; *do not* let the CLAUDE.md refresh imply C is dead (patience = C08 depends on this).

3. **Two prose-citation models, one stale — plus empty link tables.** `wa_prose_section_citations` (562, last write **2026-04-28**) vs the live `finding_citation` (51,148). And `prose_section_finding_link` / `prose_section_dimension_link` are **0 rows** (never used). The prose/citation layer needs reconciliation: confirm `finding_citation` is the live model, retire `wa_prose_section_citations`, and confirm the two empty link tables can be dropped. (Whole prose layer is CURRENT-PARKED — publication is paused.)

4. **The reference-as-DB tables are themselves stale — which defeats their purpose.** `wa_rule_registry` (last write 2026-04-17), `wa_addendum_registry` (all 22 obsolete, M35), `wa_vocab_set`/`wa_vocab_member`, and the `wa_*_pattern` registries were created (M32–M34) to be the **single source of truth** for rules/vocab/patterns — but none has been written since April, while the methodology pivoted hard May–June. **A stale single-source-of-truth is worse than none, because queries trust it.** Decision: refresh them to the current rules/vocab, or formally demote them from "canonical" and point back to the instruction docs. This is a genuine integrity issue, not just housekeeping.

5. **The filing-pattern registries are stale *and* their prose counterpart has drifted from the layout.** `wa_file_name_pattern` (23), `wa_label_pattern` (11), `wa_patch_type_registry` (20) are the **DB-resident filing/naming rules** (M34) — the table-side of `docs/file-organisation-rules.md`. Both have drifted: the doc references `data/schema/` (gone → `Workflow/schema/`), CLAUDE.md §2 omits the existing top-level `data/`, and exports have two homes (`Sessions/Session_A/STEP Extracts` + `data/exports`) — verified 2026-06-14. So **filing governance spans both these stale tables and a partly-wrong doc**, while you've flagged the folders themselves as unreliable. → **A filing audit (reconcile doc + registries ↔ actual tree) is an open item** (see 02, 04); meanwhile locate files via `file_manifest.json`, not the folders.
